# Visible-ship-dataset is a data set for ship instance segmentation tasks in visible light images. This dataset includes two types of marine ship instance segmentation 
datasets, named as MariBoats and MariBoatsSubclass respectively, which can be used for different research purpose. The MariBoats dataset used all the 6.2k images and all 
the ships labelled were assigned to only one category, namely ‘ship’, resulting in 15.7k ship segmentation annotations. This dataset with one category can satisfy the 
basic instance segmentation requirements (For example, avoiding obstacles (ships) during unmanned driving under the complex sea scene). The MariBoatsSubclass contains 
3.1k images and 4.5k ship annotations. This dataset has six categories of marine ships: Engineering Ship (Eng.), Cargo Ship (Carg.), Speedboat (Sp.), Passenger Ship 
(Pass.), Official Ship (Off.), and Unknown Ship (Unk.). This dataset can be used for both segmentation of ships and precise identification of marine ship categories in 
marine scenes. the Visible-ship-dataset draws on the construction process of the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) datasets, including visible light images with 
different resolutions. This dataset is a benchmark for researchers to evaluate their approaches.
